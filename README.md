# MazeGame
A consistently randomized maze created along side a basic GUI 

Created in Early 2019 and crafted along side a GUI for a special project

The code utalizes recursion and backtracking to craft a different maze every time that reaches the end
This code was optimized to the best of my ability in 2019. But I continue to look into ways to improve it.

Will continue to make commits on this as i get ideas to create a better system.
